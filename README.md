Transition Plugin


The project is aimed at implementing a simple transition/loading effect on a webpage at events triggered by the user. The following content(index.html) is aimed at providing the source documentation as well as a live demo of the working of the plugin. This is optmized so that users can access this via dekstop/mobile.
